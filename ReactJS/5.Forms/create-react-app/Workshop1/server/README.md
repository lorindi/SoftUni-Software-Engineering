## Base URL

The Base URL for the API is: `http://localhost:3005/api`

The documentation below assumes you are pre-pending the Base URL to the endpoints in order to make requests.

# Endpoints: Users

- `/users` -- create new user / get all users;
- `/users/{userId}` -- get / update / delete user by provided id;

## Create a new user

Create a new user by sending a `POST` request to `/users` with properties `firstName`, `lastName`, `email`, `imageUrl`, `phoneNumber` and `address`. The service will respond with an object, containing newly created user.

### Body

```
{
  firstName: string;
  lastName: string;
  email: string;
  imageUrl: string;
  phoneNumber: string;
  address: {
    country: string,
    city: string;
    street: string;
    streetNumber: number;
  }
}
```

### Success Response:

Content:

```
{
  user: {
    _id: string;
    firstName: string;

Send a `GET` request to `/users?page=1&limit=5&search=Chris&criteria=firstName&sort=createdAt&order=desc`. The service will respond with an object, containing properties `users` (an array with a maximum of 5 records, sorted in descending order by createdAt - date of creation and filtered by firstName, which includes the searched string `"Chris"`) and `count` (number of all records that match this criterion).

## Get user by userId

Send a `GET` request to `/users/{userId}`. The service will respond with an user object.

### Success Response:
