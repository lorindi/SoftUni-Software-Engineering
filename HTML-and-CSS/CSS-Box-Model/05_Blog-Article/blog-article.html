        CSS files can easily gain redundant KBs over time. It may happen due to
        leftovers from historic stylings or simply because youâ€™ve used a large
        CSS framework like Bootstrap (147 KB when minimized) and most probably
        have used only a fraction of what it has to offer. Unused CSS slows down
        page loading and makes maintenance much more difficult than it has to.
